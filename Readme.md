## Description :
The goal of this EDA project is to analysis and visualise all jobs and skills in the data science domain. Several insights and useful questions have been answered in this project.

## Goals:
* Investigate top-paying roles and skills in the data science industry.
* Use Python to explore a real-live dataset on job postings.
* For job-seekers: use these insights to help find the best job opportunities.

## Questions to Answer :
* What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?
* How are in-demand skills trending for Data Scientists?
* How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Scientists?
* What is the most optimal skill to learn for Data Scientists? (High Demand AND High Paying)

I'll be focusing on US based Data Scientist roles.
